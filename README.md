### What is it?

Moon is a simple front end javascript library heavily inspired by [Vue](https://vuejs.org). The library is fast, flexible, and easy to learn. Check out the [Medium Article](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-moon-1d44a99635f0) on the motivations for making this.

### Extras

* âœ¨ [moon-cli](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-cli) - scaffold a feature rich Moon project
* ðŸš© [moon-router](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-router) - fast router plugin for components
* ðŸ“‹ [monx](https://github.com/kbrsh/monx) - clean state management
* ðŸŒŽ [moon-ssr](https://github.com/kbrsh/moon-ssr) - universal server-side rendering
* ðŸ“Š [moon-bars](https://kbrsh.github.io/moon-bars) - beautiful bar graph component

### Another library?

There have been a lot of Javascript libraries released lately. Moon has been being developed since late 2015. Most libraries are bloated, with a large API and file size, leading to applications becoming slower, and less mobile friendly.

Moon differs from the existing solutions by providing a faster, yet compact library with a simple but powerful API. It uses a virtual DOM system similar to React, but includes advanced optimizations crafted specifically for Moon, similar to the Glimmer engine by the Ember team. In a variety of benchmarks, Moon has proven itself to be one of the fastest UI libraries out there.

Still, you do **not have to** use Moon if you are happy with your current solution, or if you have already started a project without it. If you are creating something new or would like to use it for the performance gains and intuitive API, feel free to use Moon.
