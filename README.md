# Moon

A minimal, blazing fast UI library.

### Rewrite

Moon is currently being **rewritten** to be faster, and more flexible. It will be able to support:

- Custom Render functions: this is faster, as Moon doesn't have to create a virtual DOM from nodes.
  - This means you can use JSX, to allow the full power of JavaScript in your templates
- Server Side Rendering: You can compile templates on the server side and get HTML.


### What is it?

Moon is a simple library heavily inspired by Vue.js. It's much lighter, and provides an API that is easy to learn.

### Usage

See [the website.](https://kingpixil.github.io/moon)

More documentation coming soon, Moon is under active development.

<!-- ### Benchmarks

- Rendering Time: 100Î¼s

### Roadmap

<!-- - Use Virtual DOM
  - Create Virtual DOM while seeding
  - Every build, replace (first version) of virtual dom with new data
  - Run diff algorithm against real DOM and rerender -->
